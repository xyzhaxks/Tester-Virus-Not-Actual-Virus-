# Tester-Virus-Not-Actual-Virus-
This *Virus* is basically a silly little python code...


# Main Purpose
This little python script is just a smol bean which won't stop annoying you until you, close the powershell like a NOOB!! ORRRRRRR, find the SECRET keybind to close the program safely, or just let it do silly stuff.

# Keybind Hint
It has ctrl and alt in it but there are still 2 more buttons....

ctrl+alt+____+_____
